# Data-Mining

A leading bank wants to develop a customer segmentation to give promotional offers to its customers. They collected a sample that summarizes the activities of users during the past few months. You are given the task to identify the segments based on credit card usage.

##	Conclusion:

•	In this project, we went through the customer segmentation model. We developed this using a class of machine learning known as unsupervised learning. Specifically, we made use of a clustering algorithm called K-means clustering. We analysed and visualized the data and then proceeded to implement our algorithm. With the help of clustering, we can understand the variables much better, prompting us to take careful decisions. With the identification of customers, bank can release different promotional schemes that target customers based on several parameters like credit limit, payments, spending patterns, etc. Furthermore, more complex patterns like income, shopping patterns are taken into consideration for better segmentation.
•	The K-means clustering algorithm is widely used for clustering huge data sets. But traditional k means algorithm does not always generate good quality results as automatic initialization of centroids affects final clusters. This analysis presents an efficient algorithm where we have first pre-processed our dataset based on normalization technique and then generated effective clusters. This is done by assigning weights to each attribute value to achieve standardization. Our algorithm has proved to be better than traditional K-means algorithm in terms of execution time and speed.
